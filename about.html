        <h3>My story</h3>
          <p>My name is Yuqi He. I was born on February 25, 1997 in Qianjiang, China. I was an only child before junior high school, but my parents thought it would be better to have brothers and sisters living together. When I graduated from the sixth grade of elementary school, my brother was born.  </p>
          <p>After following the school to perform in Singapore, I was mind-blowing by the distinctive culture and customs. After following the school to perform in Singapore, I was mind-blowing by the distinctive culture and customs. Since then, I decided to go abroad to study in the future and to visit more countries in the world. </p>
          <p>At the end of 2017, I received an acceptance letter from the University of Miami and finally realized my childhood dream. I am major in public relations with minor in computer science. In order to gain a foothold in society earlier after graduation,I worked two part-times jobs in Wuhan, China, in the summer. I also planned two on-campus esports competitions, which include scheme schedule and propaganda. </p>
          <p>Four years later, I graduated from the University of Miami with a bachelor's in public relations. Now I am looking forward to entering the esports industry. </p>
